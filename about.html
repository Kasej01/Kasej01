            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p class="about-intro">Welcome to my portfolio website! I'm Kase Johnson, and here's a little about me...</p>
            <p class="about-p">I've been working as a Software Engineer since 2022. I'm working on my Master's degree at Tennessee Tech university, building an AI model capable of detecting 3D printing failures in their early stages with a camera built into the printer. I've grown to love 3D design and modeling,
                 with a few of my models making it to my Etsy store (it's my way of justifying the amount of money I spend on 3D printing). </p>
            <p class="about-p">I also love gaming, specifically minecraft, campaign and strategy games such as Total War and Mount and Blade, and some first person shooters. Lately, I've 
                 gotten into minecraft plugin coding and mod coding, with a class based modifier plugin, teleporting and home setting plugins, etc. I like to think I'm a man of many hobbies.
