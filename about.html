            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p class="about-intro">Welcome to my portfolio website! I'm Kase Johnson, and here's a little about me...</p>
            <p class="about-p">I've been working as a Software Engineering Intern since 2022. I recently finished my Master's degree at Tennessee Tech University by building a computer vision AI model capable of detecting 3D printing failures in their early stages with a camera built into the printer. I've grown to love 3D design and modeling,
                 with a few of my models making it to my Etsy store (it's my way of justifying the amount of money I spend on 3D printing). </p>
            <p class="about-p">I also love gaming, specifically minecraft, campaign and strategy games. Lately, I've 
                 gotten into minecraft plugin coding and mod coding, with many different plugins that can be found on my projects page or my github page in the respositories section.
